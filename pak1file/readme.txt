# This dir contains dat files to be packed in their own pak file.
# Unlike the standard directories where all pak files are packed
# into the same pakfile.

# Put files into subdirectories named after the pak size (e.g. 128).

# ground.Outside.pak is required by simutrans to determine the size
# of the paksets tile sets. The file has to be used with this exact
# name to allow the pakset to be detected.
